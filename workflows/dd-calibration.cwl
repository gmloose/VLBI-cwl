label: Automated direction-dependent calibration for wide-field imaging
doc: |
  This is a workflow for the LOFAR-VLBI pipeline that
    * Splits a LOFAR MeasurementSet into various target directions with split-directions.cwl
    * Performs wide-field facet-calibration with the Dutch LOFAR stations
    * Performs direction-dependent calibrator selection
    * Performs self-calibration on the target directions
  This step should be run after the delay calibration workflow for wide-field imaging.
