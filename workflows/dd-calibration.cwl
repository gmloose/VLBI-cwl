doc: |
  This is a workflow for the LOFAR-VLBI pipeline that follows on the delay-calibration and:
    * Splits a LOFAR MeasurementSet into various target directions with split-directions.cwl
    * Performs direction-dependent calibrator selection with phasediff scores (see Section 3.3 from https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13247)
    * Performs self-calibration on the target directions with facetselfcal (with automatically tuned parameter settings)
