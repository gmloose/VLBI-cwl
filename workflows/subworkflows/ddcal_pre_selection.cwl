   This workflow does the following:
        * DP3 prep to average measurement to the same freq/time resolution
        * Get h5parm solutions with scalarphasediff corrections from facetselfcal
        * Get solution scores using the circular standard deviation
        * Select MS with scores below 2.3
   This selection metric is described in Section 3.3.1 from de Jong et al. (2024; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13247)
